          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage; inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used in the HTML files and it styles specific elements such as img and h using attributes.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS style sheet is found in the head element at the top of the file.</li>
          <li>The style element is used to design multiple tags using CSS rules.</li>
          <li>The most popular option is external CSS style sheet because it allows developers to have seperate files for all CSS rules.</li>
          <li>The link element is used to connect between external style sheet and the code file.</li>
          <li>A CSS rule contains a selector which defines the element/attribute to which rules/decleration will apply.</li>
