# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this webpage was to create a website that contains all my notes. The reason I build this project was to first learn how to build a website from scratch as well have one place to compile all my notes. I learned many things including how to code a HTML file. I also learned how to style a page usin a CSS style sheet. Finally, I incorporated some basic Javacodes to make the website usable.
